================================================================================

PATTERN TEMPLATE USED
---------------------
Template: Light Jacket_2D.PDS
Base Size: Large (selected automatically)
Pieces: 15 individual pattern pieces

PATTERN SCALING ADJUSTMENTS
---------------------------
Scale X (Width):  1.000  [No change]
Scale Y (Length): 0.958  [4.2% reduction]

Reason: Customer's proportions are close to standard Large, but slightly 
shorter torso/arm ratio required minor vertical adjustment.

Fit Match Quality: 100% (Perfect)

================================================================================

NESTING RESULTS
---------------
Algorithm Used: master_nest (automatic selection)
Best Algorithm: guillotine

Fabric Width:     157.48 cm (62 inches)
Fabric Length:     53.83 cm (21.2 inches)
Utilization:       78.03%

Total Pieces: 15
All pieces successfully nested
No overlapping detected

================================================================================

QUALITY CONTROL VALIDATION
--------------------------
Status: PASSED with warnings

✓ Piece count: 15 pieces (expected 12-20) - OK
✓ Geometry: All pieces valid polygons - OK
✓ Fabric utilization: 78% (good efficiency) - OK
! Fit validation: 3 measurement mismatches detected (see notes)
! Small pieces: 4 pieces flagged as narrow/small (normal for jacket details)

QC NOTES:
- Pattern dimensions are half-circumference measurements
- Customer full circumference vs pattern half-width comparison shows
  expected differences (e.g., 102cm chest vs 51cm pattern width)
- This is NORMAL for pattern cutting (front+back = full measurement)
